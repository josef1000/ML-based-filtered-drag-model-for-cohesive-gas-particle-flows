# ML-based-filtered-drag-model-for-cohesive-gas-particle-flows

In this repository all developed and used neural networks in publication ..... are stored.

All NN's have the sub-grid drift velocity $\tilde{v}_d$ as output. The drag correction function $H_d$ is then calculated

by $H_d  =  $

The NN's differ in their input:

(i) for four marker networks: $f_{DNN} (1 / \Delta^*_f, \tilde{u}_s_l_,_z)$
